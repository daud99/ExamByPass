                    <h6>What is the difference between the choices "One Exam File" and "Subscription" when buying access to an exam file?</h6>
                    <p>If you choose "One Exam File", you will buy access to exactly this one exam file. You will be able to access this file for as long as you want and you can take it as many times as you like in order to prepare yourself for the exam.If you choose "Subscription", you will get access to all .vce files and .exam files that you upload. You will be able to access the uploaded files for one month after you bought the subscription. For example, if you subscribed to a monthly plan on the 2nd of the month you will always be billed on the 2nd, until you cancel your subscription.If you do not cancel the subscription it will automatically renew one month and we will bill the monthly subscription fee to your credit card or paypal account. You can read up on how billing cycles work exactly here (PayPal) and here (credit card / Stripe). Once the subscription is cancelled it will not renew. You will of course be able to use the subscription until the end of the billing period. Once the subscription is inactive you will not be able to access any questions after question 5 in any of your exams.</p>
